## 1. SQLiteDB Class:
## Description:
The SQLiteDB class serves as a wrapper for interacting with SQLite databases. It encapsulates various methods that facilitate database operations, including connecting to a database, executing queries, and manipulating data (inserting, updating, deleting). Additionally, the class provides functionality to introspect the database schema.

## 2. Constants Section:
## Description:
The constants section includes several capability references used in prompts. These references are intended for specific purposes within the codebase:

TABLE_DEFINITIONS: Capability reference for SQLite table definitions.
SQL_QUERY: Capability reference for the generated SQLite query.
TABLE_RESPONSE_FORMAT: Capability reference for the expected response format.
SQLite: String delimiter used to separate explanations and raw SQLite queries in responses.
## 3. Database Interaction Process:
Steps:

Connect to SQLite Database:

Establish a connection to the SQLite database file.
Retrieve Data from 'Masked' Table:

Execute a query to retrieve all rows from the 'Masked' table.
Print Table Schema:

Print the schema of the 'Masked' table.
Get Table Definitions:

Retrieve all table definitions, likely for further use in the prompt.
Update Prompt with Capability Reference:

Enhance the prompt by updating it with a capability reference that incorporates the retrieved table definitions.
## 4. Prompts Definitions:
Defined Prompts:

USER_PROXY_PROMPT
DATA_ENGINEER_PROMPT
SR_DATA_ANALYST_PROMPT
PRODUCT_MANAGER_PROMPT
Creation and Rephrasing:

USER_PROXY_PROMPT: Prompt designed for user proxies, possibly tailored to their specific needs or roles.
DATA_ENGINEER_PROMPT: Prompt crafted for data engineers, likely containing queries or tasks relevant to their responsibilities.
SR_DATA_ANALYST_PROMPT: Prompt intended for senior data analysts, possibly involving complex queries or data analysis tasks.
PRODUCT_MANAGER_PROMPT: Prompt created for product managers, likely focusing on queries related to product data or analytics.
## Detailed Report:
The SQLiteDB class provides a comprehensive set of functionalities for interacting with SQLite databases. It encapsulates database operations in a modular and organized manner. The constants section ensures clarity and consistency in using capability references throughout the code. The process of connecting to the database, retrieving data, printing schema, and updating prompts with capability references follows a logical sequence.

The defined prompts, tailored for different roles (user proxies, data engineers, senior data analysts, product managers), showcase an understanding of the diverse users who may interact with the system. The capability references embedded in the prompts enhance readability and allow for dynamic adjustments based on the database schema.

This code structure promotes maintainability and extensibility, making it easier to adapt to evolving requirements or additional capabilities in the future.
